ðŸŒŸ Key Features
Game Logic: Implements real-time gameplay using combinational and sequential logic, including state machines and debouncing techniques.

Keyboard Input: Interfaced with the PS/2 keyboard to capture user moves.

VGA Output: Generates visuals to display the game board and player actions on a monitor.

Hardware Design: Utilizes shift registers, flip-flops, state machines and more for data storage and signal handling.

ðŸš€ How It Works

Game Overview:
The SOS Game is a two-player strategy game where players take turns placing "S" or "O" on a grid to form the word "SOS". The player who forms the most "SOS" patterns wins.
